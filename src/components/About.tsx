            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">As a finance major, I began my credit journey in 2018, determined to build strong credit for myself. Through strategic planning and persistence, I raised my score into the high 700s and discovered a passion for helping others do the same.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">Along the way, friends and family began asking me for guidance, and I discovered how much I enjoy teaching others what most of us were never taught in school â€” how credit really works. Over time, I turned this knowledge into a service that makes credit repair simple and effective.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">Today, I use that same approach to help individuals take control of their credit, overcome challenges, and build a foundation for lasting financial success.</p>
